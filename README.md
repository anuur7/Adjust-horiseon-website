# Adjust Horiseon Website 

The task for this assignment was for me to refactor an existing website to make it more accessible by following the acceptance criteria.

I have improved the codebase for long-term sustainability by checking that all links are functioning correctly and by increasing the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

・ Added a header, main section that    has an article inside it, an aside with sections and a footer

・ Added ID's so when you click on nav bar its scrolls to corresponding section.

・ Added descriptive alt attributes to the pictures.
